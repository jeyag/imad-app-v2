            <p>
                This is the content of the paragraph which will be displayed on the page of the website that we are creating. Although, this seems to be the first of many files, that we are going use, we have to be very careful in doing so.
            </p>
            <p>
                While still at it, why not have another paragraph to go with the first one. We Just want to see if the files that we are uploading on github works well with the git and the imad host.
